# BigO Analyzer

BigO Analyzer is a web-based tool that analyzes the asymptotic complexity (Big-O notation) of code snippets. It provides a detailed breakdown of Time Complexity (worst case, best case, and average case), Space Complexity, and the data structures used in the code. Powered by Google's Gemini AI, this project supports bilingual output (English and Portuguese) and features a responsive design built with modern web technologies.
